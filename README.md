## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Google Maps:

Navigation: Provides accurate turn-by-turn navigation for various modes of transport, making it easy to find your way.
Real-Time Traffic: Offers live traffic updates to help you avoid congestion and choose the fastest route.

MyFitnessPal:

Calorie Tracking: Allows users to log their daily food intake, helping them monitor their calorie consumption.
Exercise Logging: Lets users record their workouts and physical activities, providing a comprehensive view of their fitness routine.

Spotify:

Personalized Playlists: Curates playlists based on your music preferences and listening history.
Discover Weekly: Generates a new playlist each week with music recommendations tailored to your taste.

App Idea: CalorieMate: Easy Calorie Tracker

Idea Description: CalorieMate is a straightforward app that lets users quickly log their daily meals and snacks to keep track of their calorie intake for easy and simplified dietary management.

While developing the clicker app, I faced a notable hurdle with Swift - specifically, linking the user interface to the underlying logic posed a significant challenge for me.
